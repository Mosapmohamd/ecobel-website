"""
Tiny schema-sync helper used instead of Alembic (see the README for why).

`create_all` only creates tables that don't exist yet — it never alters an
existing table, so adding a new column to a model (like Product.image_url)
needs a manual `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` the first time the app runs
against a database created before that column existed. This module does
just that, defensively (skips any column that's already there), for both
SQLite and PostgreSQL.
